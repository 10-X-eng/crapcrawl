# Tools to make RAG easier

LLM's are extremely expensive to retrain, so I made this tool to make my life easier to pull down docs and prep them for RAG
It uses crawl4ai to scrape the page based off the sitemap.xml
It then uses chatgpt to cleanup the scrapes
Then it combines everything into one handy document to upload for RAG

# The ui is terrible

I don't care

# There are no instructions

I know, it's not that hard to figure out

# This looks like AI generated code

It is, get off my back about it
